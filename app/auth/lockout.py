def is_locked(email: str) -> bool:

    Counts rows in ``private.login_failures`` within the last ``WINDOW``
    (5 minutes). Locked when count >= ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` (5). On DB errors,
    fails open (returns False) so login is not blocked by infrastructure
    issues — the miss is logged at error level because brute-force
    protection is off while the check fails. This is the deliberate
    counterpart to ``authz.is_account_disabled``, which fails closed.

    Args:
        email: Login email (normalized to lowercase). Empty string never locks.

    Returns:
        True if the account should be refused login; False otherwise.

    Example:
        >>> if is_locked("user@example.com"):
