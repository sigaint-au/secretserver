## Python runtime (direct)

Pinned in `app/requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`. Transitive Flask/psycopg
pieces (Werkzeug, Jinja2, MarkupSafe, click, itsdangerous, blinker, cffi,
pycparser, pyasn1) are BSD/MIT and are compatible.

| Package | License |
|---------|---------|
| Flask | BSD-3-Clause |
| Werkzeug, Jinja2, MarkupSafe, itsdangerous, click | BSD-3-Clause |
| blinker | MIT |
| psycopg, psycopg-binary, psycopg-pool | LGPL-3.0-only |
| PyJWT | MIT |
| cryptography | Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause |
| gunicorn | MIT |
| ldap3 | LGPL-3.0 |

LGPL libraries are imported as separate Python packages (dynamic linking).
You may replace them with other LGPL-licensed builds. Their license texts
ship inside the installed wheels.

## Container extras

The production app image is Red Hat UBI 9 (`ubi9/python-312-minimal`).
The Compose `dev` target additionally installs AlmaLinux 9 `softhsm`
(BSD-style; binary-compatible with UBI9 because SoftHSM is not in UBI
or EPEL 9). RPM copyright files stay under `/usr/share/doc/`.
